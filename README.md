# GBScript
A Programming Language for the Gameboy

**GBScript** is a custom scripting language designed for retro game development, inspired by Lua and C. It targets the Game Boy via transpilation to C (e.g., GBDK-compatible output). GBScript aims to provide a modern, readable syntax for defining game logic while staying within the technical limits of retro hardware.
